# The SensorNode uses the Prototype RF Driver for STM Sub-1 GHz RF Expansion Boards based on the SPSGRF-868 Module for STM32 Nucleo #

Currently supported boards:
 * [SILICA SENSOR NODE](https://www.avnet.com/wps/portal/silica/products/product-highlights/2017/stmicroelectronics-sensor-node-board/)

This driver can be used together with the 6LoWPAN stack (*a.k.a.* Nanostack).
